# Overview
### Azure Resource Graph Queries

The Azure Resource Graph queries assist with gathering Azure tenant inventory for Azure resources related to Azure Synapse Analytics. They are intended to aid cost optimization, general inventory needs, normalizing or standardization of configuration, and more.

### Distribution Advisor

The Distribution Advisor (DA) feature of Azure Synapse SQL analyzes customer queries and recommends the best distribution strategies for tables to improve query performance. Queries to be considered by the advisor can be provided by the customer or pulled from historic queries available in DMV. See [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/distribution-advisor) for more information

### PowerBI

PowerBI templates to monitor your Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool. PowerBI has the ability to query the front-end of your SQL endpoint as well as the back-end Log Analytics data so you can build powerful reports. 

### Synapse Analyzer

The Azure Synapse Analyzer Report was created to help you identify common issues that may be present in your database that can lead to performance issues. This report focuses on known best practices that Microsoft has identified with SQL Dedicated Pools. Following these best practices will help to get the best performance out of your solution. The Azure Synapse Best Practice Analyzer Report should help give you insights into the health of your database. We will continue to update the report to call out defined best practices that Microsoft has defined.

### Synapse Toolkit

The Synapse Toolkit is a set of stored procedures that help investigate
current activity on your Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool. sp_status is the overall
summary procedure that calls various other procedures to provide a picture
of current activity. Use the detail_command columns to deep dive into a 
particular session, query, or wait. 

List of SPs currently included:
- sp_status
- sp_concurrency
- sp_requests
- sp_reqeusts_detail
- sp_sessions
- sp_sessions_detail
- sp_waits
- sp_waits_detail
